# TCP-AF_INET-SERVER-WITH-RPCGEN-IMPLEMENT-FOR-MULTIPLE-CLIENTS
Hello this is my first project on distributed systems if you think there can be some improvments please leave a comment,download it make your changes and lets discuss about this.

More information on how it works.

The main concept of this project is that you have 3 programs to create a tcp af inet server where the client  is sending data to the server and the server is doing the calculation through the rpc implemention and sends the answer to the client  

the first program is an RPC server that is responsible for the calculations the client asks
the second program is an RPC client who has 2 jobs to do the first is to be server socket and recieve data from the client and the second  job is to be a clasic RPC client who sends data to the RPC server  for the calculation of them
and the third program it's a simple client who sends data and is waiting to recieve the answers from the server 

Also is for multiple clients!!! 

Thank you for your time and have a nice day
